Hey there! Congratulations on creating your first site with Stubby CMS! This sample page will guide you through some of the awesome things you can do with our MDX editor. Let's make content management fun, flexible, and maybe even a bit magical! âœ¨


## 1.Markdown + Components = MDX Magic

With MDX, you get all the Markdown basics, plus the power to embed components directly in your content. It's like Markdown on steroids!

- **bold text**, and *italics* are here.
- Lists, images, code snippets? Check.
- Want a custom button or callout? Just add it in!

<Note>
**Tip:** Type `/` in the editor for quick component suggestions!

| Feature    | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Bold       | `**Content**`                                  |
| Italics    | `_Content_`                                    | 
| Components | Add `<Note>`, `<Warning>`, `<Step>`, `<Tabs>`. |


## 2. Quick frontmatter setup
